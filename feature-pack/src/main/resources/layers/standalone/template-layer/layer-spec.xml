    We already bring in our extension/subsystem module in /feature-pack/wildfly-feature-pack-build.xml since we are adding
    a configurable feature. If the feature needs additional modules we should add those in
    TemplateSubsystemDefinition.registerAdditionalRuntimePackages(). In some cases, e.g. if this layer brings in a
    set of other layers, and the interaction of those needs some additional modules, we can add them here.

    If we are not using a feature so that we don't have a /feature-pack/wildfly-feature-pack-build.xml and thus
    no TemplateSubsystemDefinition class, we would add modules here.

    In all cases, if we need to add some content other than modules, we would add those as packages here.
